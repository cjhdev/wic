Autobahn Plus Example
=====================

This example exercises the wic_plus wrapper against Autobahn Test Suite.

At the moment we only have a client.

## Client

- perf tests are disabled since they seem to be IO bound
- ./run_fuzzing_server.sh to run the test server
- ./bin/client to run the client (under test)
